            <p><strong><span>Quantum Themes</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Superstition: a quantum system can simultaneously be in two different states at once. </span></p>
            <p><span>Entanglement: </span><span>Two classical particles can be correlated with each other.</span></p>
            <p><span>No cloning: cloning cannot be done, only noisy copies.</span></p>
            <p><span>The delayed choice experiment: what happens in the present can change what happens(ed) in the past.</span></p>
            <p><span>Path integral formulation: the probability of a particle that at some place will be at some different place later can be given by a rule. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>27/11/17</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>A Few Initial Ideas</span></strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Related to the delayed choice experiment, a user can make changes to the game&rsquo;s past by going to specific locations and completing tasks. Their actions would affect the past in the game. </span></li>
              <li><span>Related to entanglement, two players are &lsquo;entangled&rsquo; and both have to perform the same actions, such as going to a specific location. </span></li>
              <li><span>Related to no cloning, a game that tries to illustrate the impossibility of cloning by having two players trying to create the same pattern but with different shapes. Would need revisions to make it more location dependent.</span></li>
              <li><span>Related to path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, a chance game where a user can walk around to change where a user can walk to change a probability meter on an app, which shows the probability the particle will move to where the user is. The aim would be to find a location with a high chance of the particle moving to, to earn some kind of reward. </span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>01/12/17 &ndash; Game in a Week</span></p>
            <h3><u><strong><span>Laying Down a Foundation</span></strong></u></h3>
            <p><span>Applying the framework to the concept that demonstrates the path integral formulation. </span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Motivation</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>My motivation is to explore a particular concept. This game would be exploring the concept of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics.</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Aims</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>For participants, I want to make this theme of quantum mechanics easy to understand, through a fun, interactive experience. </span></p>
            <p><span>The aim of the participants in the game would be to win the game, by successfully guessing where the particle will move.</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Outcomes</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>The specific goals I have in mind are to create a fun, engaging app that is most importantly educational on this theme of quantum mechanics. The success of these goals will be measured through user testing. </span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Inspiration</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Focus: People</span></p>
            <p><span>The games I have found that have been designed for a similar audience focus on providing clear instructions and explanations, to educate the younger audience on a quantum theme. </span></p>
            <p><span>They are also often fun and engaging, to make it feel like they aren&rsquo;t educational. </span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Site</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>My concept does not require a large site, but just enough room for the player to move around and change their position. </span></p>
            <p><span>The style of site that would best suit the concept is an area of space based on the player&rsquo;s location. For example, a radius of 15m around the player would be sufficient to play the game. </span></p>
            <p><span>The properties the site would need to have are few obstacles and the ability to somehow be in most spaces of the site. There are few other requirements of the site, as the focus is not on the site itself but the space. </span></p>
            <p><span>Focus: People</span></p>
            <p><span>The target audience, being younger audiences, would most likely be found in their home. A player&rsquo;s home would make a great site for the game. </span></p>
            <p><strong><span>People</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>The people that will participate in my experience would be those that have access to a phone, enjoy interactive games, and have an interest in quantum mechanics. This would most likely be the demographic of high school aged children. </span></p>
            <p><span>The impact on people/bodies by activities occurring as part of the experience would depend on where the user plays the game. If played in the private of their own home, the only people that could be affected are those that also live in that home. If played in public, the public community may take notice of the activities involved in the experience, but this would have little impact on them. </span></p>
            <p><em><span>Some statistics on elementary and high school aged students</span></em></p>

            <p><strong><span>Resources</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>From a participatory point of view, it is assumed users will have basic skills, such as moving around, comprehending instructions and a basic understanding of technology. Very little resources are required for the game, just a space to move around in and some form of smart device. </span></p>
            <p><span>From a development point of view, the knowledge to create the app will be required and an understanding of the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. </span></p>
            <p><strong><span>New Aspect</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>A new aspect that could be introduced to the game is a timer that restricts the amount of time the player has to find a spot with high probability. This would improve the game by adding an element of urgency, making the game more difficult and also more entertaining. </span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Changed Aspect</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>A changed aspect for the game could be the motivation, aims and outcomes. The current aim of the participant playing the game is not very exciting. A possible change could be the player must try to get a particle in a hole, and the probability of the particle landing in the hole will change as they change their location. </span></p>
            <p><span>This aspect would improve the framework by creating a clearer objective to the game, and a clearer method for how to win and lose. This new aspect would also allow for more advanced levels, with the hole becoming smaller as the level increases, making it harder to find a location with a high probability of the particle landing in the hole from that location.</span></p>

              <p><span>Annotations:</span></p>
              <p><span>Doing the game in a week, I interpreted the new aspects and changed aspects as new and changed aspects of the game, not of the framework. I learned in the studio that this was actually meant for the framework itself, although having to think of new and changed aspects of my game was actually helpful and really encouraged me to iterate on my design decisions and not become stuck in my ways. From this experience, I think a new aspect the framework could have is a &lsquo;design variations&rsquo; that encourages the user to look back at different sections and re-think their decisions, or even just brainstorm alternative ways to do things so that they aren&rsquo;t so focused on one idea (possibly even the first idea) that they might have thought of. This section could also involve some prompts to think outside the box with their project, such as the exercise we did in the studio session that involved thinking of a way to only use one button for each of our initial project ideas. Although these ideas may not be used in the final project, it helps to spark creativity and think about the project in a new way. This would improve the framework by encouraging more iteration on decisions, and looking back on sections of the framework in a new light.</span></p>

            <p><span>05/12/17 &ndash; Week 2</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Critiquing and Tweaking Ideas</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Today we pitched all our ideas to the group and gave and received feedback. I really like the cat cloning game pitched by Chi, where you&rsquo;ve lost you cat and need to find it by offering it it&rsquo;s favourite food or toy, but there a lots of clones of your cat to confuse you which are slightly different, due to the quantum mechanic of no cloning. It would be pretty cool if it included AR to find the cat. It was also suggested by Lorna that the site be a library to make finding the cat more complicated by having to look up books using a catalogue numbers to find cats. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>During the session, we all discussed the ideas on the posters in small groups to provide suggestions and add to the current ideas. I focused on Ryan&rsquo;s idea of &lsquo;Quantum Buddy&rsquo; for most of the session. Through brainstorming, we changed the idea a lot. The concept related to entanglement, and the initial idea involved being entangled to a &lsquo;buddy&rsquo; and having to change your coloured lane on a racetrack depending on the colour of buddy. The initial idea wasn&rsquo;t very location dependent, so we thought of ways to fit this criteria more. My suggestion was to make it similar to that primary school game that involves running to corners of the room, and each corner represents something. The instructor then calls out one of the corners and everyone in that corner is out of the game. Incorporating &lsquo;buddy&rsquo; and quantum entanglement to this game would be simple. The instructor would choose a colour for buddy that the players cant see, and they must guess which colour has been chosen. Each corner would represent a different colour option, and the players that don&rsquo;t go to the correct corner are out as they are not the same colour as buddy and therefore not entangled. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>We also discussed the framework in this session, and collated all the highs and lows of the framework. My main highs and lows were:</span></p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><p><span>Really made me think about my idea, and consider aspects I hadn&rsquo;t even thought of</span></p></li>
                      <li><p><span>It made me quickly make decisions for the idea </span></p></li>
                      <li><p><span>Provokes thought for new aspects that could improve the concept, instead of being stuck on thinking about the one idea</span></p></li>
                      <li><p><span>The theme/narrative wasn&rsquo;t something I had thought about, but this aspect of the framework made me realise its importance</span></p></li>
                      <li><p><span>Provides a clear outline of all the aspect that should be considered, even if they aren&rsquo;t relevant just yet</span></p></li>
                    </ul>
                  </td>
                  <td width="400">
                    <ul>
                      <li><p><span>Some aspects seemed less relevant to my specific idea, such as observing the site, since the site for my idea isn&rsquo;t a specific type of area, but just a radius around the player&rsquo;s location</span></p></li>
                      <li><p><span>It was hard to not just rush through the framework, since I could have provided a shallow answer for each question. I feel that the framework would be much more beneficial by applying it over a longer process</span></p></li>
                      <li><p><span>Some aspects felt like they needed to be completed before others, so completing it methodically sometimes felt like I was jumping the gun. However, I understand that the framework could be applied in any order; this was just something I found in my approach</span></p></li>
                      <li><p><span>Found some of the nodes a bit confusing, such as the relationships to other nodes</span></p></li>
                    </ul>
                  </td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>A lot of people seemed to have confusion with nodes, so we spent some time discussing what they were. This discussion did provide some clarification. Thinking of nodes as elements of interaction in the game is helpful, however I do still find some of the elements of the node confusing, such as trajectory, since there is already a trajectory section in the framework. </span></p>

            <p><strong><span>Cutting Down Ideas</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Today&rsquo;s focus was cutting down ideas to make a shortlist of the ideas that will be created. The day started with brainstorming ways to play all our games with only one button. This was helpful in thinking outside the box with our ideas. It also highlighted the ideas that had very little interactions, as it was easy to think of a way to play it with only one button. </span></p>

            <li><span>One button to select the location you&rsquo;re at. Locks in current location.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>We also had an expert in quantum mechanics come talk to us to give some clarification for some of the ideas. We especially focused on observing photons. </span></p>
            <p><span>After our quantum discussion, we went to the natural amphitheater to do an activity and also narrow down our ideas. The shortlist of ideas were quantum tic-tac-toe, cat cloning, and escape room. We then split up into to groups to do an activity with each of these ideas; I was in the cat-cloning game group. The activity involved changing the location of the game to where we were. This meant we observed the location, and brainstormed ways the cat-cloning app would suit this space. It was important that there were places the cat could hide, which there were plenty of around trees and rocks. However, since the hiding spots would be much easier to find cats in comparison to in library books, we thought introducing a more complicity was important. I suggested having to chase the cat when its found, making the game more challenging, while also suiting this new space since it&rsquo;s a very open. Since an older audience would be less inclined to run around to catch a cat, this would be more suited towards a younger audience (9-14 years old). We also decided on how the game would be played. I suggested that you have to offer a correct toy and correct food to capture your cat, and there could possibly be limited resources. The resources could also be something that you have to find in order to capture a cat.</span></p>
            <p><span>We also thought of making it more difficult by introducing more cats if the player picks the wrong cat. </span></p>

            <p><span>12/12/17 &ndash; Week 3</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Getting Started with Cat-Cloning App</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Today we used the framework to go through the main nodes for the cat-cloning app, and also discussed the foundation. </span></p>
            <p><span>We first decided whether we would make the game outdoors and targeted towards a younger audience (9-14), or inside a university library targeted towards an older audience (17-21). </span></p>
            <p><span>After weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of each option, we decided using a library makes more sense, since its on campus where this target audience exists. Using a library also provides more opportunities for using AR, since books would work well as image targets. </span></p>
            <p><span>We created a list of potential UQ libraries that could be used, and we found that books relating to quantum mechanics were found mostly in Dorothy Hill Engineering library, so thought this would be suitable. </span></p>
            <p><span>We then visited the Dorothy Hill library to look for potential places a cat could hide. We also took photos of book covers and other items that could be used for cats and also resources (quantum books for cats, food books for food items, and books related to play for toys). We made observations and took notes from the library visit, which can be seen in the images below. These observations are noted in more detail when discussed with the framework below.</span></p>

            <p><strong><span>Nodes</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>The main nodes for the cat cloning game are finding a cat and finding resources.</span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>Finding a cat:</span></p>

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>I also had a discussion with Steven about the technology that could be used to incorporate AR into the app. We decided a Pok&eacute;mon Go style AR system would work well, where the user can see a map, and can activate AR mode when they would like to collect something. Vuforia seemed like a pretty easy to use program that could facilitate this. I spent the rest of the session trying to install Vuforia and get it working, which I managed to get working on my computer &ndash; the next step is to get it working on my phone. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>I applied the discussions we had during the session to the framework after the session.</span></p>
            <p><span>Two possible motivations:</span></p>
            <ol>
            <li><span>To &lsquo;explore a particular issue&rsquo;</span> of quantum mechanics and showcase this in a playful way. For the cat cloning game, the quantum theme would be that cloning is not possible and only noisy copies are produced.</li>
            <li><span>To explore a location. This site focus would involve using the aim of finding cats as a method for exploring a site. A site option is a library, as this allows for many ways of exploring the area, such as floor plan, wall hangings, books etc.</span></li>
            </ol>
            <p><span>Aims</span></p>
            <p><span>Participants: </span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>For people to enjoy playing the game</span></li>
            <li><span>To possibly learn how to practice finding books in the library</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Myself:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>Incorporate AR technology to bring the physical world&rsquo;s site more into the digital world.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>Outcomes</span></p>
            <p><span>Goals: turn a library into an interactive, fun environment. If users find the game a bit challenging, this would be one way to indicate success. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>Inspiration </span></p>
            <p><span>Tech: </span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>Pok&eacute;mon GO</span></li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/pokemon.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="250" width="500" />
            <p class = "reference"><span>(Pok&eacute;mon GO, 2018)</span></p>
            <p>Pok&eacute;mon GO has a similar target market to the audience we&rsquo;re creating our app for. I like the way that the main part of the app is a map that shows where Pok&eacute;mon are, and the AR only happens when the user is within the vicinity of the Pok&eacute;mon. This means the app doesn&rsquo;t use up as much battery constantly using the camera, and gives the user an idea of their location. Having the main screen of our app as a floor plan of the site would also give the user an idea of their surroundings and where to look. This would be a more achievable option than doing location tracking, since the site is only a small space and therefore cant utilise map tracking.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <ul>
            <li>AR drawings</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="img/ar-inspiration.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="500" width="300" />
            <p class = "reference"><span>(QuiverVision, 2016)</span></p>
            <p><span>QuiverVision&rsquo;s 3D AR drawings use a similar technology to what we would like to use in our app. The idea of having an image target that shows an object when the camera recognises it would be a playful way to find cats, food and toys. Book covers would also work well as image targets due to their unique patterns and high contrast. It seems like Vuforia will be a good tool to use for achieving this kind of AR. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Site</span></strong></p>
            <p><u><span>Options</span></u></p>
            <p><span>Library: </span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>law library</span></li>
            <li><span>Dorothy Hill</span></li>
            <li><span>Social sciences</span></li>
            <li><span>Biology</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Other:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>park</span></li>
            <li><span>whole campus</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Considerations:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>would be beneficial if we could access a floorplan for the site, making libraries preferable. </span></li>
            <li><span>More oportunites for cracking codes and complex hiding spots in a library.</span></li>
            <li><span>Outdoor areas could incorporate running and more high intensity activities</span></li>
            <li><span>Easier to look out of place in a library due to quiet and reserved environment. However this has potential to be incorporated as a challenge in the game, and if a wrong cat is selected something could happen to make the player look out of place as punishment.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>In general:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>the site needs to be large enough to have many hiding spots and space to move around</span></li>
            <li><span>a library would best suit the ideas/context due to being able to hide cats in books etc. This would be targeted towards a different audience than if the site was outdoors, as a library site would focus more on skill and comprehension of clues, looking for books and also having access to the chosen library, over being outdoors where the focus would be more on searching much larger areas of space and chasing and looking for cats. </span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Properties required:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>hiding spots</span></li>
            <li><span>potential for clues</span></li>
            <li><span>not too crowded</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Observation of Dorothy Hill Library:</span></p>
            <p><span> When first walking into DHL as a group of four, it did feel like eyes were on us. This was my first indication that playing a game in a library might be embarrassing if attention was drawn to you.</span></p>
            <p><span>To make people feel comfortable playing this game in a library, it would have to be as inconspicuous as possible. Observations were noted of the behavior of those in the library, so that the game could involve similar actions for the player to blend in.</span></p>
            <p><span>Actions and behaviours of people in the library:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>sitting at table on computer</span></li>
            <li><span>looking for books</span></li>
            <li><span>checking out books</span></li>
            <li><span>studying</span></li>
            <li><span>very quiet </span></li>
            <li><span>listening to music</span></li>
            <li><span>typing on keyboard</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>This is the floor plan of the DHL that will be used as reference for the main page map.</span></p>

              <p><span>When observing the site, I only took a few notes as can be seen in the image above. The notes mainly included the typical actions of the people in the site, the general layout, and some catalogue numbers of books that could be used as image targets. Although this was helpful, the framework definitely gave me more aspects to think about for the site. Even if I had already thought about some of the points, applying my thoughts to the framework encouraged me to write it down. Writing down what I observed in the site using the framework as a guide definitely squeezed a lot more information out of my brain; thoughts that would have inevitably disappeared if I hadn&rsquo;t noted them down.</span></p>
            </section>
            <p><strong><span>People</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Two options:</span></p>
            <p><span>The game has potential to be targeted towards young teens (12-17) or young adults (18-25). The game would have a different gameplay depending on the audience, with targeting the game towards young adults making the focus more about cracking codes, understanding clues and finding out where cats are hiding.</span></p>
            <p><span>Targeting the game towards teens would be more about catching, rather than solving puzzles. This would involve more high intensity activities to catch cats. </span></p>
            <p><span>With the location options at university, it makes more sense to target the game towards young adults, as this audience has constant access to the libraries, which is an ideal place for solving puzzles. Teens would still be a secondary audience, as there are often school excursions where they could access the library and use the game as a way to explore the site. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Finding (out about) People</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>This app would hopefully draw attention to the library and attract people to going there. So the focus would be attracting new visitors over designing for current library goers who would most likely go to the library to study or find a book. </span></p>
            <p><span>Allen Bevans, a UX researcher as Google, has identified five distinct segments of players based on these dimensions:</span></p>
            <img src="img/people-stats1.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="300" width="459" />
            <p class = "reference"><span>(Bevans, 2017)</span></p>
            <p><span>The cat cloning game has no in-game social aspects, but would require the player to have a passion to play the game. This would therefore define the players as &lsquo;playful explorers&rsquo;. </span></p>
            <img src="img/people-stats2.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="300" width="550" />
            <p class = "reference"><span>(Bevans, 2017)</span></p>
            <p><span>This category of player prefers puzzle games, and also like strategy and adventure games, and the cat cloning game would fall under these categories. </span></p>
            <p><span>The cat cloning game will most likely be more appealing to females than males, due to its nature. However, no genders will be excluded from the market and the game&rsquo;s development will not be influenced by the target market&rsquo;s likely gender. </span></p>

            <p><span>20/12/17 &ndash; Week 4</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Testing with Vuforia</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>I&rsquo;ve been using this link to learn how to use Vuforia in Unity:</span></p>
            <p><span><a class='link' href="https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-an-ar-android-app-with-vuforia-and-unity/">https://www.sitepoint.com/how-to-build-an-ar-android-app-with-vuforia-and-unity/</a> </span></p>
            <p><span>So far it has been very helpful, and I have been able to create a demo app that displays a little warrior (which I got from the Unity asset store) when a target image is recognised. I&rsquo;ve been playing around with its capabilities and seeing how much it can recognise. The target image has to have a lot of definitive patterns and contrast so that the camera is able to pick it up. I have tested it with a couple of the book cover images and it works, however the real test will be seeing if it still recognises these book covers when I&rsquo;m not just testing it with the image I&rsquo;ve uploaded of the book cover, but the actual book cover. </span></p>
            <p><span>Getting the app to work on my iPhone turned out to be a bit of challenge. To get it on my iPhone, I had to update my phone, Xcode, my computer and Unity. Eventually, I got it to work! I used a random book and random asset for the demo, and found a Kitten asset from the Unity store and made a more fitting demo using a book from the library as the target image.</span></p>
            <img src="img/demo.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="200" />
            <p><span>I plan on using this break to try to get the technology working well, so that when I go back to the sessions its easy to adapt it to our idea, and build upon with my group.</span></p>

            <p><span>05/01/18 &ndash; Week 5</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Applying the Framework</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>I spent this last week of the break to focus more on &lsquo;the experience itself&rsquo; section of the framework, which I haven&rsquo;t really touched on yet apart from looking at the main nodes before going on break. </span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Experience Itself of &lsquo;Quantum Cat&rsquo;</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Theme/Narrative: the narrative to Quantum cat is that the player has lost their cat and has to find it with the challenge of slightly different clones appearing. The narrative is non-linear, since there is no clear path for the user to experience. The user&rsquo;s experience is created by the choices they make in where they explore, and collecting resources and cats.</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Trajectory</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>At a participant level, users will need to find the correct books by using the hints, to find the correct resources and cat.</span></p>
            <p><span>At a system level, the app will need to know when the user has found an image target, when they have collected resources, and when they give a cat correct or incorrect food or toys.</span></p>
            <p><span>At a content level, there will need to be objects for each of the cats, the types of toys, and types of food, as well as image targets for each of these objects. </span></p>
            <p><span>At a dependency level, the user must solve where to find the books containing resources, collect the resources, find the book that contains the correct cat, and feed the cat the correct resources. </span></p>
            <img src="img/trajectory.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="200" />
            <p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
            <p><strong><span>Tools</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Participant owned: mobile/smart phone/tabet with camera</span></p>
            <p><span>Site owned: books</span></p>
            <p><span>Introduced by you: Vuforia, Unity assets, android device for testing, images of book covers, graphics.</span></p>
            <p><span>Users will know what they&rsquo;re supposed to do with the facilitators through using the hint cards.</span></p>
            <p><span>Automated &ldquo;hands-off&rdquo; system. </span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Public Face</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Since the app is being made for the competition, we haven&rsquo;t really thought about the public face of &lsquo;Quantum Cat&rsquo;, since it wont actually be made public. However, the app will have consistent visual styling. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p><span>Most of these points were things that had already been decided upon, and applying the framework just involved writing them out. Although writing them out is beneficial, it felt more like the framework was a guide for documentation rather than a guide for design. I may have had a different opinion if I had used this section of the framework to come up with an idea, however our idea mostly developed naturally through discussion and brainstorming, and this feels much too structured to be have been applying in the early days.</span></p>
              <p><span>I also found the framework difficult to use collaboratively, as any changes I thought of that could be made to the idea would have to be discussed with the group. This meant I wasn&rsquo;t really focusing on thinking about changes that could improve the app, but was instead writing out all the decisions that had been made with my group before we went on break. I did find the framework easier to use when being used collaboratively, however the environment of this project wasn&rsquo;t great for constant collaboration of the framework, and my group wasn&rsquo;t very active on Slack or Facebook for discussions of ideas. </span></p>
              <p><span>The public face section also didn&rsquo;t feel very relevant to this project, since our projects aren&rsquo;t being made public. However, I understand that this could be something that needs to be considered in a project being made for release to public.</span></p>
              <p><span>These notes made about the framework were never really referred back to. This might have been because I didn&rsquo;t feel the need to revise these decisions, however I feel that I may have gotten more out of the framework if I continued to iterate over these design decisions I made. If there was less pressure to get the concept developed into a functioning app, I would have liked to spend more time in the design and prototyping stage to get the chance to iterate over the decisions made with the framework and collaborate ideas with my group. </span></p>

          <section>
            <p><span>09/01/18 - 10/01/18 &ndash; Week 6</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Back to Sessions</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>Prompt - Current snapshot of where I&rsquo;m at:</span></p>
            <p><span>With my current progress, it feels that the framework and the development are two separate pieces of work, and although they relate to each other, the progress in the development of the app isn&rsquo;t related to the areas I&rsquo;ve been focusing on in the framework. </span></p>
            <p><span>The framework is much more design focused, which makes it tricky to be developing the app while simultaneously making design decisions. Especially since I&rsquo;m not creating low fidelity prototypes due to the time constraints of the project, whilst also learning to use Vuforia. It&rsquo;s also hard to not be thinking about my capabilities with Unity and Vuforia when using the framework, as some of the ideas I&rsquo;ve had feel too far-fetched to accomplish in time. With my current experience with the framework, I feel like it would be more suited to being used more by a design team, then handed onto a development team to be created. </span></p>
            <p><span>The framework has a lot of questions in order to get you thinking about things, since it&rsquo;s designed around &lsquo;think about this, think about that&rsquo;, rather than &lsquo;do this, do that&rsquo;. However, I find that this isn&rsquo;t as helpful as telling me steps to go through, and things to do. It felt like I was on my own when it came to thinking about things, since I usually prefer checklists or steps that help achieve a task. Since there isn&rsquo;t any order to using the framework, this also made me feel a little lost and overwhelmed about where the best place to start would be. To me, it would be more beneficial if the framework had more guidelines, structure or tasks that help with the &lsquo;thinking about things&rsquo;. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>As a group, we had a detailed discussion of how the game would actually be played. Hints are a big part of playing the game, to the give the user direction and actually give the game a purpose. </span></p>
            <p><span>We were trying to decide how hints would work &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re something that&rsquo;s just given, something the player has to collect, or the player has a limited amount. To help us make these decisions, I brought out the framework to look at the nodes section. </span></p>
            <p><span>We started with trigger options. We decided the options were:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>button press + limited hints</span></li>
            <li><span>button press + infinite hints</span></li>
            <li><span>button press + time restrained</span></li>
            <li><span>AR hints + finding them</span></li>
            <li><span>Non AR hints + finding them on map</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>We also had to decide the trajectory for hints:</span></p>
            <ul>
            <li><span>one hint for entire game that tells the player what to look for</span></li>
            <li><span>one &lsquo;free&rsquo; directional hint that gives the player a general idea + 3 specific hints that replenish every hour</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>The notes made in this session can be seen below.</span></p>
            <img src="img/hints.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="200" />

            <p><span>We decided for the sake of time, and my Unity skills, we would start by implementing the simplest option of one hint card that is available the entire game and tells the player what to look for. We can develop upon this later if there&rsquo;s time. </span></p>

              <p><span>Using the framework to try and help us make this decision made me realise that the framework&rsquo;s nodes section is helpful for defining the elements that need to be considered for a point of interaction in the game, however didn&rsquo;t provide much assistance in making these decisions. Although the framework isn&rsquo;t meant to be an answer booklet, it felt frustrating to have no new ideas after bringing out the framework. Once we all decided on the trigger for hint, the rest of the node sections felt more irrelevant, as most of the elements were either obvious to our game or we had already decided upon. </span></p>

            <p><span>In the afternoon, we went to library to see if image detection worked on the books – it did! Some of them were detected kind of poorly, and the item that appeared on the book was a bit shaky, so we removed these ones when we got back to the room.</span></p>
            <p><span>We also started thinking about the graphics we&rsquo;ll need for the app. At the moment the buttons are just have the generic Unity skin, so something a bit more stylistic would be good. We&rsquo;ll also need more graphic elements for the map page, which currently just has a button that leads to the camera. The map page will need:</span></p>
            <ul>
              <li><span>a floor plan of the library</span></li>
              <li><span>a character card of the cat that needs to be found</span></li>
              <li><span>hint card</span></li>
              <li><span>and buttons for all these elements to appear.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span>Kaira, Chi and Florence are going to work on these graphics while I continue developing the app. I did find out how to share the Unity project with everyone using the &lsquo;collab&rsquo; feature, so everyone has a copy of the project. However, the rest of the group has stated they feel more comfortable doing designs over implementation.</span></p>
            <p><span>Unity kept crashing when trying to add a button when an image target was detected. After research I found out this was because Vuforia doesn&rsquo;t have an updated release to work with the updated version of Unity. Going back to a previous version of unity would mean I&rsquo;d also have to go back to a previous version of Xcode to get the app running on my iPhone. However, a previous version of xcode would not be compatible with my iPhone version. I spent some time looking into alternative AR tools, however vuforia was definitely the easiest to use, possibly because I already knew how to use it. I downloaded a previous Unity version and there was no longer any crashing. I then had to learn how to put a unity app onto an android phone, which turned out to be a lot quicker and easier than playing on an iPhone. </span></p>
            <p><span>Kiara sent through a character card example she made which will be replaced with the actual cat and its information when ready. </span></p>
            <img src="img/charactercard.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="178" width="100" />
            <p><span>Since the card is portrait, it worked well when the phone was in portrait mode, but in landscape mode it was cut off. We decided to set the app to be played in landscape mode, so Kiara made a new card that suited landscape mode. </span></p>

            <p><span>16/01/18 - 17/01/18 &ndash; Week 7</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Incorporating Graphics</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>I found a c# script made by Vuforia that allows buttons to appear when an image target is detected, so now our objects have buttons! They&rsquo;re quite small, and I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to make the text larger, but I can worry about that later. </span></p>
            <p><span>At the moment we&rsquo;ve decided to keep it unlimited resources. This can always be changed if we want to, but it&rsquo;s important we get most of the app working before spending time on specific gameplay details, such as having limited resources that can be collected. When the button is pressed, it increases a counter on the screen. In todays session I incorporated some of the graphics made by the rest of the group. </span></p>
            <p><span>These are the floor plan graphics made by Florence, which will be used as the base image of the map page.</span></p>
            <img src="img/level3.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="200" width="250" />
            <img src="img/level4.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="200" width="200" />
            <p><span>Kiara made some buttons to replace the generic buttons currently being used. </span></p>
            <img src="img/camera_button.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="60" width="120" />
            <img src="img/card_button.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="60" width="200" />
            <img src="img/map_button.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="60" width="100" />
            <p><span>I suggested that maybe the buttons could be graphics rather than text, as this would fit more nicely into phone&rsquo;s screen space, and would also be easier to identify quickly.</span></p>
            <p><span>With this feedback, she created these buttons, which were incorporated into the app.</span></p>
            <img src="img/camerab.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="100" width="150" />
            <img src="img/cardb.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="100" width="150" />
            <img src="img/mapb.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="100" width="150" />
            <img src="img/hintb.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="100" width="150" />
            <p><span>Florence also made this graphic for the food item counter.</span></p>
            <img src="img/food_counter.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="200" width="200" />
            <p><span>We still have to incorporate the toys into the app, however at the moment I&rsquo;m focusing on getting the food incorporated correctly into the game. </span></p>
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>Kiara created cat skins that will be used as the &lsquo;noisy copies&rsquo; of the original cat. I&rsquo;ve currently implemented three cats in the game, the original cat, a muddy cat, and a cat with green eyes. Today&rsquo;s session involved me trying to get a pop-up that appeared when the player gives a cat a food item that tells the user whether that cat likes that food. I&rsquo;ve made it so that there are two hidden &lsquo;message&rsquo; GameObjects, for when the cat likes the food and doesn&rsquo;t like the food. Kiara created these backgrounds for the messages.</span></p>
            <img src="img/background.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="100" width="200" />
            <p><span>Each cat now shows the incorrect message for two of the food options, and a correct message when its favourite food is given (and each cat has a different favourite food). Now that this is functional, incorporating the toys should be pretty simple, as it will be a similar process but replacing food with toys. </span></p>
            <img src="img/right-food.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />
            <img src="img/wrong-food.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>The rest of the group found this toy asset that they wanted to use, and Florence created the same style inventory as the food for these toy assets. </span></p>
            <img src="img/toy_counter.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="200" width="200" />
            <p><span>However, at home when I was trying to import this asset for the Unity store, I found out it was incompatible with my Unity version. So I looked for other toy assets we could use, but the choices for free packages were slim. I told the group and we decided it wasn&rsquo;t urgent and we&rsquo;d find some random toy objects to use next week. </span></p>
            <p><span>We also had a discussion of how our hint card would give the player direction about what to do and where to go. We thought it would be cool if the hint was like a &lsquo;detective-style&rsquo; cork board that showed the target cat and it&rsquo;s favourite food, toy and books where these can be found. To make it more cryptic, the books could be water damaged, and coloured string could depict the cat&rsquo;s likes and dislikes. </span></p>

            <p><span>23/01/18 &ndash; Week 8</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>User-Testing and Working on Game</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>In the first session this week, we worked on incorporating the hint and character cards into the game. The original game idea was to only have one cat that needed to be found, but after a group discussion, we decided the game would have more purpose if the player had to match up multiple cats with their favourite toy and food. </span></p>
            <p><span>Kiara created these first hint and character cards for one of the cats that need to be found, and will continue working on others.</span></p>
            <img src="img/kitty-kat.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />
            <img src="img/hint-card.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />
            <p><span>I implemented the new toy counter based on the toy resources in these hint cards, and got the messages working for the toys in the same way as the food items.</span></p>
            <img src="img/toycounter2.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="200" width="200" />
            <img src="img/right-toy.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />
            <img src="img/wrong-toy.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />
            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>I conducted some user testing to get some last minute feedback on improvements that could be made to the game&rsquo;s interactions and functionality.</span></p>
            <img src="img/user-testing.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="200" width="150" />
            <img src="img/user-testing1.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="200" />
            <img src="img/user-testing2.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="200" />

            <p><span>During the testing session, I discovered that when switching back to the map mode, any resources collected in camera mode disappear. This could be a challenging feature of the game, however could also just be frustrating. Since the submission is only a video this &lsquo;feature&rsquo; just wont be showcased, and if we are shortlisted and continue working on the game this is something we&rsquo;d have to conduct more user testing on to decide if it should be changed. </span></p>
            <p><span>The test user also gave feedback to change the button method for collecting resources. They said it would be more intuitive to just click the item to collect it, instead of pressing a separate button. I spent the rest of the session trying to implement this, which involved some pretty scary problems including the camera not working, however eventually the problems were fixed and the tap to collect feature was implemented. </span></p>

            <p><span>30/01/18 &ndash; Week 9</span></p>
            <p><strong><span>Finishing Up</span></strong></p>
            <p><span>I implemented these new hint and character cards into the game. I then spent some time working on being able to flip between them on the map page. </span></p>
            <img src="img/snowball.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />
            <img src="img/snowball-hint.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />


            <p><span>I then worked on creating a &lsquo;win-state&rsquo; of the game; it isn&rsquo;t very official, but it will demonstrate the idea for the video. I put in a button the says &ldquo;this is my cat&rdquo;, and when the player is confident that the cat they&rsquo;ve found is one of the correct ones, they can click that message and a win or lose message appears. </span></p>
            <img src="img/right-cat.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />
            <img src="img/wrong-cat.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />


            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>I suggested to the rest of the team that we give the game more context with an introduction card at the start that appears when the player begins the game. This card&rsquo;s purpose would be to explain narrative and the goal of the game. Kiara created this, which I then put in as a pop-up on the map page.</span></p>
            <img src="img/narrative.jpg" class="thumbnail" height="150" width="220" />

            <p><span>I then made sure the cats likes and dislikes in the game match up to the character card.</span></p>
            <p><span>While I worked on these implementation tasks, the rest of the group created a storyboard for our video. We filmed the video in the afternoon and Kiara edited the shots together that night. This was our final video:</span></p>

            <p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p><span>We then worked on our game description for the submission, and once that was done submitted our game!</span></p>
